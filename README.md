# 🎓 Student Performance Factors Analysis 📊

## Project Overview 🌍

**Student Performance Factors Analysis** is a data analysis project designed to identify and understand the **key factors influencing student academic performance**. Using **Python**, **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**, the project explores relationships between **study habits**, **socioeconomic conditions**, and **access to learning resources** to reveal patterns that affect exam outcomes.

## Dataset Details 📊

**Source:** [Student Performance Factors Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lainguyn123/student-performance-factors)

**Records:** 6,607 student entries

**Data Categories:**

* **Student Behavior:** Study habits, sleep quality, attendance ⏰
* **Socioeconomics:** Family income, parental education, access to resources 💰
* **External Environment:** Teacher quality, school type, peer influence 🏫

---

## Problem Statement 🎯

The goal of this project is to **determine which factors correlate most strongly with academic performance**.

Specifically, the analysis tests:

1. The relationship between **socioeconomic factors** (internet access, family income) and **exam scores**.
2. The relationship between **student study behaviors** (study hours, access to materials) and **exam scores**.

---

## Use Cases 💼

* **Educational Institutions:** Identify performance gaps and design targeted student support programs. 🏫
* **Teachers & Mentors:** Personalize teaching approaches based on behavioral and socioeconomic trends. 👩‍🏫
* **Policy Makers:** Develop policies to support low-income students and bridge access inequalities. 📚
* **Researchers:** Explore data-driven methods to predict and enhance academic outcomes. 🔬

## Approach 🛠️

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:**
   * Handled missing values, standardized categorical variables, and normalized numeric fields.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Conducted descriptive and correlation analyses using **pandas**, **numpy**, **matplotlib**, and **seaborn**.
   * Visualized relationships between socioeconomic and behavioral variables.

3. **Insight Generation:**
   * Derived interpretations connecting study patterns and access to resources with academic success.

## Analysis Steps 🔍

### 1. **Data Preparation** 🧹

* Verified data quality and consistency across demographic and performance metrics.
* Encoded categorical data for effective comparison.

### 2. **Descriptive Analysis** 📈

* Assessed **average performance**, **distribution of scores**, and **spread** of study behaviors.

### 3. **Correlation Analysis** 🔗

* Explored links between:
  * **Family income & Exam Scores**
  * **Internet access & Study Hours**
  * **Study Hours per Week & Access to Learning Materials**

### 4. **Visualization** 🎨

* Used **matplotlib** and **seaborn** to visualize:
  * Score distributions
  * Socioeconomic vs. performance relationships
  * Study behavior patterns

## Results & Deliverables 🏆

* **Clean, Integrated Dataset** ready for analysis and visualization.
* **Key Insights:**
  1. **General student performance patterns:** Analysis of average exam scores and their distribution, revealing the overall academic performance landscape and spread of student achievement.
  2. **Socioeconomic status differences:** Examination of variations in students' socioeconomic backgrounds and their correlation with one another across different demographic factors.
  3. **Socioeconomic status and study hours correlation:** Investigation of the relationship between students' socioeconomic status and the amount of time they dedicate to studying daily.
  4. **Study hours and educational resource access:** Analysis of the correlation between weekly study hours and access to educational materials, including how these factors impact exam scores.
  5. **Combined impact on performance:** Evaluation of how socioeconomic status and study behaviors collectively relate to and influence student academic performance.
* **Data Visualizations** showcasing factor correlations.
